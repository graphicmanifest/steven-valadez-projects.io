	  <p>Hello, my name is Steven Valadez. Welcome to my portfolio. Although, it may seem a bit empty right now, I have some content coming to fill in all this white space. Currently, I am learning CSS, this is after acquiring HTML knowledge. All through my wonderful Fiances recommendation--Codecademy. So far, I think Codecademy is great! But it's a bit too slow on the teaching. Which is fine. Not so great for the enthusiastic learner though. Anyway, thanks for stopping by and checking out my progress.</p></div>

	<h2> What you can expect from this.</h2>
	<p> This will slowly become my portfolio. I will include everything that I run into in my Software/Programing/Web Developing journey. I consider myself a beginner at the time of writing this so it'll take some time getting used to this documentation.</p>
	
	<h2>Who am I?</h2>
	<p> I am Steven Valadez. I am 23 years old. Happily engaged to my beautiful Finace Erika Avalos. We recently became First time Home Owners of a cozy cave. Cozy and comfy with our mut pupper Kylo (named after the crybaby Kylo Ren). My Fiance and I are both embarking on this endless virtual journey. We dont mean to toot our horns but we're confident things are gonna go pretty good. We have the drive, the patience, the skill of learning. This is our career. This is our purpose. </p>
	
	<h2>My Experience</h2>
	<p> Computers are not foreign to me. Before getting into programming I had a facination for Grpahic Design. My skills in Adobe Illustrator are strong but not advanced, if that makes sense. Im confident in visiual design. One can say I hava a knack for it. Programming wise I'm a new born baby to this world. I havent even oepened my eyes. I havent even scraped the surface. But, Im ready to change that. </p>
	
	
	<h2>My goals for this website</h2>
	<p>There's no way of knowing when the end will be of this website. I want to say maybe when I've reached a level of skill that speaks for itself rather than documenting. My end goal is to saturate this website with content to the point where things are bumping into each other from testing and sampling different features. I want this website to be clean but I also want it to have its quirks from messing with the possibilities.</p>
